============
Installation
============

At the command line::

    $ pip install mozilla-django-oidc


Quick start
===========

After installation, you'll need to do some things to get your site using
``mozilla-django-oidc``.


Requirements
------------

This library supports Python 3.6+ on OSX and Linux.


Acquire a client id and client secret
-------------------------------------

Before you can configure your application, you need to set up a client with an
OpenID Connect provider (OP).

You'll need to set up a *different client* for every environment you have for
your site. For example, if your site has a -dev, -stage, and -prod environments,
each of those has a different hostname and thus you need to set up a separate
client for each one.

You need to provide your OpenID Connect provider (OP) the callback url for your
site. The URL path for the callback url is ``/oidc/callback/``.

Here are examples of callback urls:

* ``http://127.0.0.1:8000/oidc/callback/`` -- for local development
* ``https://myapp-dev.example.com/oidc/callback/`` -- -dev environment for myapp
* ``https://myapp.herokuapps.com/oidc/callback/`` -- my app running on Heroku

The OpenID Connect provider (OP) will then give you the following:

1. a client id (``OIDC_RP_CLIENT_ID``)
2. a client secret (``OIDC_RP_CLIENT_SECRET``)

You'll need these values for settings.

Choose the appropriate algorithm
--------------------------------

Depending on your OpenID Connect provider (OP) you might need to change the
default signing algorithm from ``HS256`` to ``RS256`` by settings the
``OIDC_RP_SIGN_ALGO`` value accordingly.

For ``RS256`` algorithm to work, you need to set either the OP signing key or
the OP JWKS Endpoint.

The corresponding settings values are:

.. code-block:: python

    OIDC_RP_IDP_SIGN_KEY = "<OP signing key in PEM or DER format>"
    OIDC_OP_JWKS_ENDPOINT = "<URL of the OIDC OP jwks endpoint>"

If both specified, the key takes precedence.

Add settings to settings.py
---------------------------

Start by making the following changes to your ``settings.py`` file.

.. code-block:: python

   # Add 'mozilla_django_oidc' to INSTALLED_APPS
   INSTALLED_APPS = (
       # ...
       'django.contrib.auth',
       'mozilla_django_oidc',  # Load after auth
       # ...
   )

   # Add 'mozilla_django_oidc' authentication backend
   AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = (
       'mozilla_django_oidc.auth.OIDCAuthenticationBackend',
       # ...
   )

You also need to configure some OpenID Connect related settings too.

These values come from your OpenID Connect provider (OP).

.. code-block:: python

   OIDC_RP_CLIENT_ID = os.environ['OIDC_RP_CLIENT_ID']
   OIDC_RP_CLIENT_SECRET = os.environ['OIDC_RP_CLIENT_SECRET']


.. warning::
   The OpenID Connect provider (OP) provided client id and secret are secret
   values.

   **DON'T** check them into version control--pull them in from the environment.

   If you ever accidentally check them into version control, contact your OpenID
   Connect provider (OP) as soon as you can, disable that set of client id and
   secret, and generate a new set.


These values are specific to your OpenID Connect provider (OP)--consult their
documentation for the appropriate values.

.. code-block:: python

   OIDC_OP_AUTHORIZATION_ENDPOINT = "<URL of the OIDC OP authorization endpoint>"
   OIDC_OP_TOKEN_ENDPOINT = "<URL of the OIDC OP token endpoint>"
   OIDC_OP_USER_ENDPOINT = "<URL of the OIDC OP userinfo endpoint>"


.. warning::
   Don't use Django's cookie-based sessions because they might open you up to
   replay attacks.

   You can find more info about `cookie-based sessions`_ in Django's documentation.

.. _cookie-based sessions: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/http/sessions/#using-cookie-based-sessions


These values relate to your site.

.. code-block:: python

   LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL = "<URL path to redirect to after login>"
   LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL = "<URL path to redirect to after logout>"


Add routing to urls.py
----------------------

Next, edit your ``urls.py`` and add the following:


.. code-block:: python

   from django.urls import path

   urlpatterns = [
       # ...
       path('oidc/', include('mozilla_django_oidc.urls')),
       # ...
   ]


Enable login and logout functionality in templates
--------------------------------------------------

Then you need to add the login link and the logout form to your templates.
The views are ``oidc_authentication_init``, ``oidc_logout``.

Django templates example:

.. code-block:: html+django

   {% if user.is_authenticated %}
     <p>Current user: {{ user.email }}</p>
     <form action="{% url 'oidc_logout' %}" method="post">
       {% csrf_token %}
       <input type="submit" value="logout">
     </form>
   {% else %}
     <a href="{% url 'oidc_authentication_init' %}">Login</a>
   {% endif %}

Jinja2 templates example:

.. code-block:: html+jinja

   {% if request.user.is_authenticated %}
     <p>Current user: {{ request.user.email }}</p>
     <form action="{{ url('oidc_logout') }}" method="post">
       {{ csrf_input }}
       <input type="submit" value="logout">
     </form>
   {% else %}
     <a href="{{ url('oidc_authentication_init') }}">Login</a>
   {% endif %}

Additional optional configuration
=================================

Validate ID tokens by renewing them
-----------------------------------

Users log into your site by authenticating with an OIDC provider. While the user
is doing things on your site, it's possible that the account that the user used
to authenticate with the OIDC provider was disabled. A classic example of this
is when a user quits his/her job and their LDAP account is disabled.

However, even if that account was disabled, the user's account and session on
your site will continue. In this way, a user can quit his/her job, lose access to
his/her corporate account, but continue to use your website.

To handle this scenario, your website needs to know if the user's id token with
the OIDC provider is still valid. You need to use the
:py:class:`mozilla_django_oidc.middleware.SessionRefresh` middleware.

To add it to your site, put it in the settings::

    MIDDLEWARE = [
        # middleware involving session and authentication must come first
        # ...
        'mozilla_django_oidc.middleware.SessionRefresh',
        # ...
    ]


The :py:class:`mozilla_django_oidc.middleware.SessionRefresh` middleware will
check to see if the user's id token has expired and if so, redirect to the OIDC
provider's authentication endpoint for a silent re-auth. That will redirect back
to the page the user was going to.

The length of time it takes for a token to expire is set in
``settings.OIDC_RENEW_TOKEN_EXPIRY_SECONDS``, which defaults to 15 minutes.


Getting a new access token using the refresh token
--------------------------------------------------

Alternatively, if the OIDC Provider supplies a refresh token during the
authorization phase, it can be stored in the session by setting
``settings.OIDC_STORE_REFRESH_TOKEN`` to `True`.
It will be then used by the
:py:class:`mozilla_django_oidc.middleware.RefreshOIDCAccessToken` middleware.

The middleware will check if the user's access token has expired with the same
logic of :py:class:`mozilla_django_oidc.middleware.SessionRefresh` but, instead
of taking the user through a browser-based authentication flow, it will request
a new access token from the OP in the background.

.. warning::

   Using this middleware will effectively cause ID tokens to no longer be stored
   in the request session, e.g., ``oidc_id_token`` will no longer be available
   to Django. This is due to the fact that secure verification of the ID token
   is currently not possible in the refresh flow due to not enough information
   about the initial authentication being preserved in the session backend.

   If you rely on ID tokens, do not use this middleware. It is only useful if
   you are relying instead on access tokens.

To add it to your site, put it in the settings::

    MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = [
        # middleware involving session and authentication must come first
        # ...
        'mozilla_django_oidc.middleware.RefreshOIDCAccessToken',
        # ...
    ]

The length of time it takes for a token to expire is set in
``settings.OIDC_RENEW_TOKEN_EXPIRY_SECONDS``, which defaults to 15 minutes.

Connecting OIDC user identities to Django users
-----------------------------------------------

By default, mozilla-django-oidc looks up a Django user matching the email field
to the email address returned in the user info data from the OIDC provider.

This means that no two users in the Django user table can have the same email
address. Since the email field is not unique, it's possible that this can
happen. Especially if you allow users to change their email address. If it ever
happens, then the users in question won't be able to authenticate.

If you want different behavior, subclass the
:py:class:`mozilla_django_oidc.auth.OIDCAuthenticationBackend` class and
override the `filter_users_by_claims` method.

For example, let's say we store the email address in a ``Profile`` table
in a field that's marked unique so multiple users can't have the same
email address. Then we could do this:

.. code-block:: python

   from mozilla_django_oidc.auth import OIDCAuthenticationBackend

   class MyOIDCAB(OIDCAuthenticationBackend):
       def filter_users_by_claims(self, claims):
           email = claims.get('email')
           if not email:
               return self.UserModel.objects.none()

           try:
               profile = Profile.objects.get(email=email)
               return [profile.user]

           except Profile.DoesNotExist:
               return self.UserModel.objects.none()


Then you'd use the Python dotted path to that class in the
``settings.AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS`` instead of
``mozilla_django_oidc.auth.OIDCAuthenticationBackend``.


Creating Django users
---------------------

Generating usernames
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a user logs into your site and doesn't already have an account, by default,
mozilla-django-oidc will create a new Django user account. It will create the
``User`` instance filling in the username (hash of the email address) and email
fields.

If you want something different, set ``settings.OIDC_USERNAME_ALGO`` to a Python
dotted path to the function you want to use.

The function takes in an email address as a text (Python 2 unicode or Python 3
string) and returns a text (Python 2 unicode or Python 3 string).

Here's an example function for Python 3 that doesn't convert the email address
at all:

.. code-block:: python

   import unicodedata

   def generate_username(email):
       # Using Python 3 and Django 1.11+, usernames can contain alphanumeric
       # (ascii and unicode), _, @, +, . and - characters. So we normalize
       # it and slice at 150 characters.
       return unicodedata.normalize('NFKC', email)[:150]


.. seealso::

   Django username:
       https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/contrib/auth/#django.contrib.auth.models.User.username


Changing how Django users are created
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your website needs to do other bookkeeping things when a new ``User`` record
is created, then you should subclass the
:py:class:`mozilla_django_oidc.auth.OIDCAuthenticationBackend` class and
override the `create_user` method, and optionally, the `update_user` method.

For example, let's say you want to populate the ``User`` instance with other
data from the claims:

.. code-block:: python

   from mozilla_django_oidc.auth import OIDCAuthenticationBackend
   from myapp.models import Profile

   class MyOIDCAB(OIDCAuthenticationBackend):
       def create_user(self, claims):
           user = super(MyOIDCAB, self).create_user(claims)

           user.first_name = claims.get('given_name', '')
           user.last_name = claims.get('family_name', '')
           user.save()

           return user

       def update_user(self, user, claims):
           user.first_name = claims.get('given_name', '')
           user.last_name = claims.get('family_name', '')
           user.save()

           return user


Then you'd use the Python dotted path to that class in the
``settings.AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS`` instead of
``mozilla_django_oidc.auth.OIDCAuthenticationBackend``.


.. seealso::

   https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#StandardClaims


Preventing mozilla-django-oidc from creating new Django users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you don't want mozilla-django-oidc to create Django users, you can add this
setting::

    OIDC_CREATE_USER = False


You might want to do this if you want to control user creation because your
system requires additional process to allow people to use it.


.. _advanced_claim_verification:

Advanced user verification based on their claims
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In case you need to check additional values in the user's claims to decide
if the authentication should happen at all (included creating new users
if ``OIDC_CREATE_USER`` is ``True``), then you should subclass the
:py:class:`mozilla_django_oidc.auth.OIDCAuthenticationBackend` class and
override the `verify_claims` method. It should return either ``True`` or
``False`` to either continue or stop the whole authentication process.

.. code-block:: python

   class MyOIDCAB(OIDCAuthenticationBackend):
       def verify_claims(self, claims):
           verified = super(MyOIDCAB, self).verify_claims(claims)
           is_admin = 'admin' in claims.get('group', [])
           return verified and is_admin

.. seealso::

   https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#StandardClaims


Log user out of the OpenID Connect provider
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a user logs out, by default, mozilla-django-oidc will end the current
Django session.  However, the user may still have an active session with the
OpenID Connect provider, in which case, the user would likely not be prompted
to log back in.

Some OpenID Connect providers support a custom (not part of OIDC spec) mechanism
to end the provider's session.  We can build a function for
``OIDC_OP_LOGOUT_URL_METHOD`` that will redirect the user to the provider after
mozilla-django-oidc ends the Django session.


.. code-block:: python

   def provider_logout(request):
       # See your provider's documentation for details on if and how this is
       # supported
       redirect_url = 'https://myprovider.com/logout'
       return redirect_url


The ``request.build_absolute_uri`` can be used if the provider requires
a return-to location.


Troubleshooting
---------------

mozilla-django-oidc logs using the ``mozilla_django_oidc`` logger. Enable that
logger in settings to see logging messages to help you debug:

.. code-block:: python

   LOGGING = {
       ...
       'loggers': {
           'mozilla_django_oidc': {
               'handlers': ['console'],
               'level': 'DEBUG'
           },
       ...
   }


Make sure to use the appropriate handler for your app.
